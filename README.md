## Getting Started

Clone the repo,install dependencies, build the code, and run it!

```sh
npm install
npm run build
npm run test
npm start
```

Then navigate to http://localhost:3007 and click on the buttons to see some reactive events in action.

## Deployment

Don't forget to set the environment variable `NODE_ENV=production` to avoid the slower, dev version of React. 

```sh
PORT=80 NODE_ENV=production node dist/server.js
```
